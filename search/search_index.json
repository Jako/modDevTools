Search and replace The Extras menu contains a new entry modDevTools, which opens a separate manager page. page opens. It allows you to search and replace text in the contents of chunks and templates. Enter the string you want to search for and click the Search button. Below the search field there are checkboxes to limit the search to specific elements (chunks and templates). After a successful search, the code of all found elements is displayed, with the search text highlighted. A replacement must be made for each found element individually. For this purpose there are three buttons below the code block: Replace , Replace all and Skip . The Replace button replaces the search string at the position where the cursor is located (dark highlighting) with the replacement string. The Skip button moves the cursor to the next match. The Replace All button replaces all search strings in the code of the current element. There are also two other buttons on the right side below the code element: Update and Quick Update . When you click the Update button, the element's edit page opens. Clicking the Quick Update button opens a modal window where you can quickly edit the element. Edit linked elements The editing page of chunks, snippets and templates contains some additional tabs. These tabs allow you to edit the content of linked (used) elements on the current page. The following element pages contain the tabs listed below. Chunk Templates - The code of templates in which the currently edited chunk is called. If you have installed Ace, you can get an assignment of chunks in the template code. Chunks - The code of chunks that are called in the currently edited chunk. Snippet parameters specified in the call and default snippet parameters related to chunks also appear here. Snippets - The code of snippets that are called in the currently edited chunk. Under the code of snippets you can expand the description of their default settings. Resources - List of resources that are included in the template or whose content is called in some way in this chunk. You can go to the edited resource, open it in the browser, quickly change the template or publishing status or delete it to the trash.

Linked Breadcrumb Path On the Edit Resources page, a linked breadcrumb path is inserted title below the page title. You can click any section of this breadcrumb path to edit the clicked resource. There are two system settings for changing parts of this breadcrumb path. This breadcrumb path is not shown in MODX 3.x, since this version uses is an own breadcrumb path.
